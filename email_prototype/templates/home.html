              <p style="text-indent: 50px">Hello guys how are you there. Welcome to my Email prototype application. Ya finally this is gonna be my 10th repo in Github. This is an moderately built app bcz its just an prototype with moderate security factors using hashes every where, not like Google but prevents from serious flaws, yes that's good. I have built it using Flask since I was learning Flask for a couple of weeks, In order to test my knowledge with it, I am implementing it. if you guys are not aware of me, I have also done an simple Blog app from 3 days of learning Flask that's without User login option. If you are interested I am leaving out the source <a href="https://github.com/ersanjeevkm/my_first-ever-blog">here</a>, Go and check it out. </p>
              <p style="text-indent: 50px">And of next I am gonna learn django next, There I am gonna make the Same blog with added user account facilities, I can do the same here in Flask, but I am pretty much used to Flask and it seems to more me doing the same User accounts there. And one last thing guys, this is just an prototype and application, moreover you can send mail to the accounts only registered to this account since I haven't synced accounts with any other email service provider. Please don't login with your personal credentials, and also don't use it for personal purpose. </p>
